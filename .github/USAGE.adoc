= Discord OIDC Provider: Usage guide

== Configuring your OIDC infrastructure

Service maintainers:

- Decide an audience name (by convention it is the service's origin)
- Decide scopes needed for each route

Clients maintainers:

- Request a client identifier from the OP maintainer
- Get your callback URL as configured in your OIDC lib
- List all audiences and scopes needed for operations
- Send these elements to the OP maintainer

OP maintainer:

- Configure the `clients.json` with these elements (see xref:INSTALL.adoc[Installation guide])
